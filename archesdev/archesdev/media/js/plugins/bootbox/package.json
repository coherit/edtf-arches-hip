  "readme": "# Bootbox - Bootstrap powered alert, confirm and flexible dialog boxes\n\nPlease see http://bootboxjs.com for full usage instructions, or head over to http://paynedigital.com/bootbox for\nthe original writeup about the project.\n\n## Contact\n\nThe easiest thing is to [find me on twitter @makeusabrew](http://twitter.com/makeusabrew).\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/makeusabrew/bootbox/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for guidelines.\n\n## Running Tests [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/makeusabrew/bootbox.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/makeusabrew/bootbox)\n\nTests are run using [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.8/index.html) using the Mocha test adapter.\nTo run the tests yourself, simply run ```npm install``` within the project followed by ```npm test```.\nPlease note that this will require [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) being installed and in your path - if\nit is not, you may run the tests and capture browsers manually by running ```karma start``` from the root\nof the project.\n\nThe project is also hosted on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/makeusabrew/bootbox) - when submitting\npull requests **please** ensure your tests pass as failing requests will be rejected. See the\n[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/makeusabrew/bootbox/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more information.\n\n## Building a minified release\n\nThe repository no longer contains a minified bootbox.min.js file - this is now only generated\n[for releases](https://github.com/makeusabrew/bootbox/releases). To build your own minified copy\nfor use in development simply run ```npm install``` if you haven't already, followed by ```grunt uglify```.\nThis will generate a bootbox.min.js file in your working directory.\n\n## A note on Bootstrap dependencies\n\nBootbox **4.0.0** is the first release to support Bootstrap 3.0.0.\n\nBootbox **3.3.0** is the *last* release to support Bootstrap 2.2.x.\n\nMuch more dependency information can be found [on the Bootbox website](http://bootboxjs.com/#dependencies).\n\n### Roadmap\n\nThe latest major release of Bootbox - 4.0.0 - involved a total rewrite of the\ninternal code and introduced an entirely new public API. It has not re-implemented\nsome functionality from the 3.x series as of yet; this will be addressed in the\nthe form of new minor releases. Please feel free to add feedback and requests.\n\nThere is no new major (e.g. 5.x) release on the roadmap at present.\n\n### Latest Release: 4.4.0\n\n* Allow `backdrop` options of `true` and `false` to dismiss modals\n* Pass dialog as `this` value in callbacks\n* Bootstrap 3.3.2 compatibility\n* jQuery 1.11.2 compatibility\n* Add support for `maxlength` prompt input attribute\n* Gracefully detect lack of Bootstrap library rather than crashing\n* Expose `addLocale` and `removeLocale` for custom locale settings\n* Expose `setLocale` helper to select a locale rather than using `setDefaults(\"locale\", ...)`\n* Add Hungarian locale\n* Add Croatian locale\n* Add Bulgarian locale\n* Add Thai locale\n* Add Persian locale\n* Add Albanian locale\n\nFor a full list of releases and changes please see [the changelog](https://github.com/makeusabrew/bootbox/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (C) 2011-2015 by Nick Payne <nick@kurai.co.uk>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
